🚀 ClipPulse AI — The AI Engine for Viral Short-Form Content

Predict trends. Generate viral scripts. Win attention.

ClipPulse AI is a lightweight, fast, and AI-powered SaaS platform that helps creators, brands, and agencies discover emerging trends across TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts — then automatically generates high-converting video scripts and content ideas tailored to their niche.

Built from the ground up by a solo developer,ClipPulse AI uses real-time public signals, trend velocity models, and LLM-powered creative generation to give users their next viral idea before it peaks.

✨ Why ClipPulse AI Exists

Creators, small businesses, and influencers face a massive problem right now:

Trends move too fast

Algorithms change weekly

Creative blocks slow down content output

Competition is intense

Existing AI tools (Jasper, Copy.ai) are too broad and not built for shorts

ClipPulse AI solves this by focusing only on short-form virality.

It acts like a trend radar + content strategist + scriptwriter — all in one lightweight system designed to run even on modest hardware.

🌍 Who It’s Built For
👤 Aspiring Creators

Want to grow but don’t know what to post. Need direction + ideas.

🏪 Small Business Owners

Need content to get customers, but have no time or skills.

⭐ Influencers / Social Media Managers

Need constant content but face creative burnout.

💼 Agencies

Want to automate trend research + idea generation at scale.

📊 Market Opportunity

TAM: $18B (1.8B creators × $10/yr)

SAM: $4.5B (450M creators & small businesses)

SOM: $225M (5% penetration)

Competition exists — but there is no dominant player focused purely on short-form virality.

ClipPulse AI fills that gap.
